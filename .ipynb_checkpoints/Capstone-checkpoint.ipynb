    "\n",
    "Q learning is about revisiting states. We are in a specific state s at time t, and because the state space is sufficiently small, we might discover that the agent has already been in s before. It therefore has made an experience for s by taking an action, and collecting a reward or punishment. All this is stored in the agent's \"memory\" (possible a dictionary of dictionaries, main keys being the states, values being the actions (keys) and their values). We want the agent to take advantage of this \"memory\": We look up the expected lifetime rewards per each possible action in s (a.k.a. action-value function, q values), select the maximum q value, and execute the chosen action. \n",
    "\n",
    "We now have fresh evidence about the consequence of a specific action in a specific state: We know the initial state s_t, we know the selected action a_t, we know the reward r_t, and we know the new state this all lead to, s_t1. This knowledge we now use to update the agent's memory: We calculate a new q value for s_t by taking the observed reward r_t, and adding to it the discounted maximum q value for s_t1. The difference to the old q value is the new q value for action a_t in state s_t."

    "## Why It Often Does Not Work: Exploding State Spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "Revisiting states is often not possible, because there are simply too many combinations of relevant inputs which constitute a state. Just think a small number of inputs, each input being a floating number with 4 digits. Even this small setting is creating a large amount of combinations: the state space explodes. Revisiting states is very unlikely, we will need a huge number of trials to generate memory updates. As a consequence, learning is slow, or even not happening.\n",

    "In this situation, we replace the \"revisiting states\" by a function approximator: We let a Artifical Neural Net (ANN) estimate the q function for the state s the agent is visiting at time t. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once we performed the action based on the maximum of the q function (just the action with the highest expected lifetime reward at time t), we know the reward, and the subsequent state. \n",

    "\n",
    "- For the action taken, we can update the q value now. All the other actions are not performed, we do not know about the reward, or a subsequent state s_t1. So, we cannot learn for those. This updated q function is the TARGET.\n",

    "At this point, let us tackle the issue of getting stuck in local minima. As a remedy, Reinforcement Learning makes use the so called *epsilon greedy* action selection policy. It allows for a random move with probability epsilon, and by that introduces the notion of exploration (random moves) vs. exploitation (act on estimation of the q function). \n",
    "\n",
    "*Exploration* will reduce the probability of getting stuck in local minima, which are *not* reflecting the best action given a certain experience level of the agen. It's just like fresh air for the AI brain, introducing random ideas from outside. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the agent needs to train and get experience with his selected moves. It needs evidence that one decision was (not) the right one, and to update its decicion finding process (the weights of the ANN. It only gets it by acting according to its own decisions undisturbed by random inputs. This is where *exploitation* comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "In RL, usually epsilon decreases over a certain exploration period. This reflects the idea that the agent will start with many random moves to fathom the environment by just observing. With time and growing experience, it will decrease the share of random moves, since it feels more confident in its own decisions. \n",
    "\n",
    "I will follow th custom of allowing random moves at a linearly decreasing exploration rate during the exploration period. The dqn paper TODO is starting with epsilon = 1 / complete randomness. Let us see what brings good results here. Balancing exploration and exploitation is in itself subject to learning.\n",

    "Concretely, we now define a interval between the maximum and minimum epsilon allowed: EPSILON_RANGE.\n",

We thus stop counting episodes (N_EPISODE) and establish global settings for the total number of time steps (TOTAL_TIME_STEPS) and the total number of exploration time steps (TOTAL_EXPLORATION_STEPS).\n",

    "The question crossed my mind: Why don't we predict beforehand, on the fly, at every time step? Would that not be computationally efficient? This has the huge disadvantage that we predict with the knowledge available at timestep t. This might be faulty, and the faulty prediction stays as target reference in the batch, and is used to compare the loss for the taken action between the prediction at timestep t and the potenitially long ago target estimation. This will bias the learning process significantly. Thus, we select a batch, calculate the estimations and targets for the complete batch, both with the knowledge of the current time steps.\n",
