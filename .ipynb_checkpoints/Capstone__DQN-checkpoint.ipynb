    "## Why Reinforcement Learning As My Capstone?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "I have a background in supervised learning mostly, a bit also unsupervised, and I've been applying these techniques to hands-on business use cases for 10 years now.\n",
    "\n",
    "When I applied for the machine learning engineer nanodegree, I wanted to deepen my knowledge in areas known to me, and also discover new areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both objectives were met during the course. The latter came into play with the Smartcab task, and I was struck. This was new. It combined two areas where I see a steep learning curve for me as well as a lot of interesting applications in business life:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Firstly, Artifical Neural Nets as the main computing block of learning. During my studies, networks were not as much on the screen as today. During this project, I will thus need to dive into this topic and gain insights which will drive my interest and career onwards. I see networks as a generic computing block, helpful in many areas of prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Secondly, Reinforcement Learning. Markov Decision Processes are just a lot of fun and a real challenge for a greenhorn brain. Still, there are components of supervised learning and statistics in general, which I can apply hereby. Lastly, I am interested in robotics and learning in general, i.e. getting (sensory) data, transform it, predict, and see how the reward or punishment gets in. Human learning is fascinating, as is machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "- I will try to train an toy, Atari-based AI agent on 1D input data. \n",
    "\n",
    "- I will not touch 2D visual inputs, since I found that convolutions are a separate topic block whick easily can be implemented as an extension to the presented building blocks. Besides that, one could also convert 2D to input 1D beforehand and proceed with the presented blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The models will consist of fully-connected layers, activation functions and output layers in the appropriate form.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In order to train the model, I will benchmark three reinforcement learning algorithms:\n",
    "    - Deep Q Learning\n",
    "    - Advantage Actor-Critic Policy Gradients\n",
    "    - Q Actor-Critic Policy Gradients\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep Q Learning is the natural entry point, since I can use my so-far knowledge of standard Q Learning and go one step further with it. Besides that, it only uses one model, compared with Policy Gradients, where two models come into play. I will develop the algorithm step-by-step, since it was the process I had to go through anyway to understand the logic. \n",
    "\n",
    "Policy Gradients will not be developed step-by-step, but recycling many building blocks of Deep Q Learning as well as the methodology.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benchmarking will be starting with brute-force parametrization combinatorics in order to hopefully find working models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this is expected to be computationally intensive, I will shift computation to AWS EC2 cloud.\n",

    "### Main Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "We are working with Elon Musk's Open AI Gym (https://gym.openai.com/) as a training environment for our AI agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lunar Lander environment (https://gym.openai.com/envs/LunarLander-v2) is particularily appealing to me. It is based on box2d, which simulates real life physics. Charming! And, with its 1D input state vector, it is a first step for creating and tuning an AI agent, before proceeding with convolution preprocessing of 2D inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The environment home page says the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "*\"Landing pad is always at coordinates (0,0). Coordinates are the first two numbers in state vector. Reward for moving from the top of the screen to landing pad and zero speed is about 100..140 points. If lander moves away from landing pad it loses reward back. Episode finishes if the lander crashes or comes to rest, receiving additional -100 or +100 points. Each leg ground contact is +10. Firing main engine is -0.3 points each step. Solved is 200 points. Landing outside landing pad is possible. Fuel is infinite, so an agent can learn to fly and then land on its first attempt. Four discrete actions available: do nothing, fire left orientation engine, fire main engine, fire right orientation engine.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "Model building and training is done with Keras (https://keras.io). This modular, minimalist library makes ANN life as easy as it can get, and in plus runs on both Theano and Tensorflow backends."

    "## The Starting Point: Evaluating Bellman Equations From Data (Q-Learning)\n",
    "\n",
    "Q learning is about revisiting states. We are in a specific state s at time t, and because the state space is sufficiently small, we might discover that the agent has already been in s before. It therefore has made an experience for s by taking an action, and collecting a reward or punishment. All this is stored in the agent's \"memory\" (possible a dictionary of dictionaries, main keys being the states, values being the actions (keys) and their values). We want the agent to take advantage of this \"memory\": We look up the expected lifetime rewards per each possible action in s (a.k.a. action-value function, q values), select the maximum q value, and execute the chosen action. \n",
    "\n",
    "We now have fresh evidence about the consequence of a specific action in a specific state: We know the initial state *s_t*, we know the selected action *a_t*, we know the reward *r_t*, and we know the new state this all lead to, s_t1. This knowledge we now use to update the agent's memory: We calculate a new q value for *s_t* by taking the observed reward *r_t*, and adding to it the discounted maximum q value for *s_t1*. The difference to the old q value is the new q value for action *a_t* in state *s_t*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Q-Learning Often Does Not Work: Exploding State Spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "Revisiting states is often not possible, even in the long run, because there are simply too many combinations of relevant inputs which constitute a state. Just think a small number of inputs, each input being a floating number with 4 digits. Even this small setting is creating a large amount of combinations: the state space explodes. Revisiting states is very unlikely, we will need a huge number of trials to generate memory updates. As a consequence, learning is slow, or even not happening.\n",

    "In order to illustrate the point, we are going to set up a basic q-learning algorithm:"

Then, it corrects again, and again, and from all these corrections forgets to fire against the moon's gravity, and the agent is crashing into the surface.\n",

For example, it stays on the ground, engaging left and right engine forever, perfectly stable, but not reaching the ultimate goal. Or a setting where left and right engines are engaged, but the lower engine does not fire at all, over long episodes.\n",

    "\n",
    "At this point, let us tackle the issue of getting stuck in local minima. As a remedy, Deep Q Learning makes use the so called *epsilon greedy* action selection policy. It allows for a random move with probability *epsilon*, and by that introduces the notion of exploration (random moves) vs. exploitation (act on estimation of the q function). \n",

    "On the other hand, the agent needs to train and get experience with his selected moves. It needs evidence that one decision was (not) the right one, and to update its decicion finding process (the weights of the ANN. It only gets it by acting according to its own decisions undisturbed by random inputs. This is where *exploitation* comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "In RL, usually *epsilon* decreases over a certain exploration period. This reflects the idea that the agent will start with many random moves to fathom the environment by just observing. With time and growing experience, it will decrease the share of random moves, since it feels more confident in its own decisions. \n",
    "\n",
    "I will follow th custom of allowing random moves at a linearly decreasing exploration rate during the exploration period. Following Deep Mind: Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning (p.6), we define a interval between the maximum and minimum *epsilon* allowed (*EPSILON_RANGE*), starting with complete randomness, and ending with 10% random moves. The exploration period (*NUM_EXPLORATION_STEP*) is set to 1/10 of *NUM_EPISODE*.\n",

    "The question crossed my mind: Why don't we predict beforehand, on the fly, at every step? Would that not be computationally efficient? This has the huge disadvantage that we predict with the knowledge available at timestep t. This might be faulty, and the faulty prediction stays as target reference in the batch, and is used to compare the loss for the taken action between the prediction at timestep t and the potenitially long ago target estimation. This will bias the learning process significantly. Thus, we select a batch, calculate the estimations and targets for the complete batch, both with the knowledge of the current steps.\n",

    "At this point, we will finalize training by applying some more tweaks, outside and within the model block. The goal is to find the best parameter combination by brute force. We install some extra bookeeping, and will save a model for every training method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most importantly, we establish two new parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Steps per Action (*SPA*) determines how many steps pass before a fresh action is taken. Deep Mind - Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning suggests 4 skipping 4 time steps before conducting an action (p.6).\n",
    "- Reward Clipping (*R_CLIP*) is also an idea taken from Deep Mind - Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning (p.6), where it was implemented in order to make rewards comparable across the different games.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides that, we collect statistics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The reward sum per episode (*re*)\n",
    "- The number of steps per episode (*te*, already known and implemented)\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we establish a parameter testing routine, which will go through parameter settings with brute force. For each of the parameter settings, the weights and the model are saved. Once a well-working setting is obtained, we will have the opportunity of directly running from the pre-learned weights."
