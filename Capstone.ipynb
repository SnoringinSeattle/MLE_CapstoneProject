    "Lunar Lander environment (https://gym.openai.com/envs/LunarLander-v2) is particularily appealing to me. It is based on box2d, which simulates real life physics. Charming! And, with its 1D input state vector, it is a first step for creating and tuning an AI agent, before proceeding with convolution preprocessing of 2D inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The environment home page says the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "*\"Landing pad is always at coordinates (0,0). Coordinates are the first two numbers in state vector. Reward for moving from the top of the screen to landing pad and zero speed is about 100..140 points. If lander moves away from landing pad it loses reward back. Episode finishes if the lander crashes or comes to rest, receiving additional -100 or +100 points. Each leg ground contact is +10. Firing main engine is -0.3 points each frame. Solved is 200 points. Landing outside landing pad is possible. Fuel is infinite, so an agent can learn to fly and then land on its first attempt. Four discrete actions available: do nothing, fire left orientation engine, fire main engine, fire right orientation engine.\"*\n",

    "## Chapter 1: The Starting Point: Q-Learning, or: Evaluating Bellman Equations from data\n",
    "\n",
    "Q learning is about revisiting states. We are in a specific state s at time t, and because the state space is sufficiently small, we might discover that the agent has already been in s before. It therefore has made an experience for s by taking an action, and collecting a reward or punishment. All this is stored in the agent's \"memory\" (possible a dictionary of dictionaries, main keys being the states, values being the actions (keys) and their values). We want the agent to take advantage of this \"memory\": We look up the expected lifetime rewards per each possible action in s (a.k.a. action-value function, q values), select the maximum q value, and execute the chosen action. \n",
    "\n",
    "We now have fresh evidence about the consequence of a specific action in a specific state: We know the initial state *s_t*, we know the selected action *a_t*, we know the reward *r_t*, and we know the new state this all lead to, s_t1. This knowledge we now use to update the agent's memory: We calculate a new q value for *s_t* by taking the observed reward *r_t*, and adding to it the discounted maximum q value for *s_t1*. The difference to the old q value is the new q value for action *a_t* in state *s_t*."

    "### Why Q-Learning Often Does Not Work: Exploding State Spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "Revisiting states is often not possible, even in the long run, because there are simply too many combinations of relevant inputs which constitute a state. Just think a small number of inputs, each input being a floating number with 4 digits. Even this small setting is creating a large amount of combinations: the state space explodes. Revisiting states is very unlikely, we will need a huge number of trials to generate memory updates. As a consequence, learning is slow, or even not happening.\n",

    "The question crossed my mind: Why don't we predict beforehand, on the fly, at every frame? Would that not be computationally efficient? This has the huge disadvantage that we predict with the knowledge available at timestep t. This might be faulty, and the faulty prediction stays as target reference in the batch, and is used to compare the loss for the taken action between the prediction at timestep t and the potenitially long ago target estimation. This will bias the learning process significantly. Thus, we select a batch, calculate the estimations and targets for the complete batch, both with the knowledge of the current frames."
