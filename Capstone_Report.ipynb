    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## I. Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine living a complex world, where a myriad of different situations can occur, where the interaction of events are numberless and unpredictable. In this world, we human beings need to adapt, to learn, and to find a way to persue our development and secure self-preservation. In other words, we need to make use of the overwhelming amount of information around us to forge a strategy on how to survive or, at best, to thrive.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a non-trivial task, since we are forced to include ever new situations when we act. We might know similar situations from previous experience, but hardly exactly the same situation twice (just think of the film \"Groundhog's Day\"). \n",
    "\n",
    "The strategy is then to deduce, induce, take the next best fitting experience, and, most importantly, after having acted, to observe the consequences and *update our experience according to the consequences*. The consequences might not occur right away after an action taken, it may take a long while, and yet we must be able to track a consequence back to a certain action / decision we took beforehand. \n",
    "\n",
    "What we humans do is applicable for machines too. Back in the days (and still), machines have been programmed determinically, i.e., for a finite set of situations, an appropriate action was hard coded. But machine can be brought to learn too, without a pre-defined plethora of \"if - then\" statements, but with the ability to react to changing environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the domain of *Reinforcement Learning (RL)*, which again is a domain of Machine Learning. In Reinforcement Learning, the agent interacts with its environment and is confronted with a chain of decision problems. This describes a  *Markov Decision Process (MDP)*. After a row of actions, the agent obtains a reward (which can be negative), and adapts its strategy to maximize the reward. Reinforcement Learning embraces a range of methods on how to train an agent to act according to inputs available and a long-term objective. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project is about to train an agent how to learn in such a chain of events. The agent for this project is a toy robot called the *Lunar Lander*, acting in an environment close to a toy moon surface. \n",
    "\n",
    "Rocket trajectory optimization is a classic topic in Optimal Control. The Lunar Lander appeared as early as 1969 in the hype around Neil Armstrong and the race for the mooon, and starred several games since then. The object of the game is to land a lunar lander savely on the moon surface. In order to obtain this, the player needs to manoeuvre with propulsion properly, or else the lander crashes on the moon. Due to the weak gravitational forces the module is only slowly accelerated, and despite of the vacuum on the moon, the game is including a slowing air resistance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, there will be no player, but only the lander acting as a autonomous agent, taking in inputs, acting, and learning from experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is about training the Lunar Lander to learn landing on the toy moon. This serves as a toy example, ready to be extended to real-life tasks, and as a starter for my research on this area.\n",
    "\n",
    "The toy environment is provided by Elon Musk's [Open AI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/). It made available the lunar lander module for training Reinforcement Algorithms. It uses a 2D engine in the background (Box2D) in order to simulate the physics in the vicinity of the moon surface. This will be the agent's environment throughout the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The project is designed as a storyline, developing and comparing four algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Algorithm 1 is the standard *Q Learning* algorithm. I hereby wrap up the lessons learned from the *Smartcab* section of the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree by applying them onto the Lunar Lander.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Algorithm 2 is *Deep Q Learning (DQN)*, which I will - for reasons reflecting my own learning on the subject - is developed step-by-step away from standard Q Learning up to a fully fledged DQN.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Finally, I will present two Policy Gradient algorithms \n",
    "\t\n",
    "    - Monte-Carlo Policy Gradients\n",
    "\t\n",
    "    - Action-Value Actor-Critic Policy Gradients\n",
    "\n",
    "Before taking the step from algorithm 1 to algorithm 2 a basic Artifical Neural Network will be developed. This again is on account to reflect my learning on the subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithms need to solve two paramount problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Upon what experience / model the agent should take an action? Or: How should the agent determine which action might be beneficial given the circumstances?\n",
    "\n",
    "- How should the agent update the experience / model after an action, in order to make it more accurate when assessing future circumstances?\n",
    "   \n",
    "The algorithms are presented in a standardized, comparable way, in order to make detection of differences and similarities among them easier. \n",
    "\n",
    "They will be trained and benchmarked against one another by clearly defined metrics, with help of non-exhaustive parameter space exploration. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since this is computationally extremely expensive, this project is not only about the algorithms, but also about on *where* to implement them. *High Performance Computing (HPC) on the Cloud* will therefore be discussed too in this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "A significant share of detailed information is included as comments directly in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this report, I intend to provide a basis for further exploration by establishing Reinforcement Learning algorithms and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). I expect to show first successes when training the agent, enabling to to continue improving the infrastructure in the right direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## II. Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Exploration and Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A Markov Decision Process over a sequence of steps `t` is characterized by \n",
    "\n",
    "- a set of states `s` an agent can be faced with\n",
    "\n",
    "- a set of actions `a` an agent can take\n",
    "\n",
    "- a set of new states `s'` an agent can end up after having taken an action\n",
    "\n",
    "- a reward `r` an agent faces after having taken an action\n",
    "\n",
    "- a transition probability `T`/ policy, which indicates the agent which action to take, and which it has to learn\n",
    "\n",
    "A full MDP is called an *Episode*. An episode is a period of steps t during which the agent is in play, i.e. has not yet crashed or succeeded to land properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "An arbitrary number of subsequent Episodes is called an *Epoch*. It is the main block of training for an AI agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open AI Gym is taking care of state space (called *observations*), the action space, and the rewards. What is left is to learn a well suited transition policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The step interaction between environment and agent boils down to the following single code line:\n",
    "\n",
    "\t# Observe after action a_t\n",
    "\tx_t, r_t, done, info = ENV.step(a_t)\n",
    "\n",
    "where `ENV` is an instance of the Open AI Gym Lunar Lander environment (see below for details [Preparing an Environment]), `x_t` is a state `s'` obtained by action `a_t`, and `r_t` is the associated reward for the transition. `done` is an indication if the Episode has ended, and `info` will be neglected, since not relevant for the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of above-mentioned step is e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "\tarray([-0.0051157 ,  0.93505154, -0.26596503, -0.19845303,  \n",
    "\t\t\t0.00819082, 0.10553619,  0. ,  0. ])\n",
    "\t\t\t, -2.7344571275052219, False, {}\n",
    "\n",
    "- The state space is a 1D vector of 8-digit floating numbers, whereas the coordinates w.r.t. the moon are the first two numbers in the state vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The reward is described as follows in Open AI documentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Reward for moving from the top of the screen to landing pad and zero speed is about 100..140 points. If lander moves away from landing pad it loses reward back. Episode finishes if the lander crashes or comes to rest, receiving additional -100 or +100 points. Each leg ground contact is +10. Firing main engine is -0.3 points each frame. Solved is 200 points.\n",
    "- done results in a boolean, `True` or `False`\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent has four different actions at its disposition:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fire the main engine, which principally counteracts gravity\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fire the left engine in order to correct insufficient angles\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fire the right engine, likewise\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do not fire at all\n",
    "\n",
    "All four firing actions are discrete, i.e. fire engine at full throttle or do not fire at all. Again, after the documentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "> According to Pontryagin's maximum principle it's optimal to fire engine full throttle or turn it off. That's the reason this environment is OK to have discreet actions (engine on or off).\n",
    "\n",
    "The docs are indicating a few other points worth considering:\n",
    "\n",
    ">Landing pad is always at coordinates (0,0). (...) Landing outside landing pad is possible. Fuel is infinite, so an agent can learn to fly and then land on its first attempt. Four discrete actions available: do nothing, fire left orientation engine, fire main engine, fire right orientation engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exploratory Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to see an agent in heuristic action, run:\n",
    "\n",
    "\tgit clone https://github.com/openai/gym.git\n",
    "\tpython gym/envs/box2d/lunar_lander.py\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to see an agent doing random actions, please run __code snippet 02__ in the code section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing heuristic behaviour to the random one, it is immediately visible that a random approach does not bring great merit here. Firing all engines at random lets the agent crash every single time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithms and Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Understanding the Gist of Artificial Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting to implement a Q estimator, I want to understand how an ANN works. According to Andrew Trask's manual, I create a network with one hidden layer, and the output layer, both sigmoid activated, which returns probablities for each of the outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "I use a sigmoid activation function due to the easy calculation of the derivative and the widespread application in neural nets.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the procedure, the magic happens with `layer_2_weighted_loss`: Each output loss is multiplied by the slope / gradient of the predicted value on the sigmoid curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to get a feeling for changes invoked by changing parametrization, I will alter the learning rate `ALPHA` as well as the number of neurons in the hidden layer `NUM_HIDDEN_NEURON` within an arbitrary range.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Code snippet 03__ shows the implementation of such a toy network.\n",
    "\n",
    "When looking at the output, it is clearly visible that the parametrization of the network has an impaction upon the network performance. Some configurations work well, like e.g. a hidden size of 8 with an `ALPHA` of 100, whereas as of a certain hidden size, the results stay at a bad level.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Preparing the Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The environment for the whole project is created once. The initialization procedure is created in a way \n",
    "\n",
    "- I create an instance (ENV) of the current Lunar Lander environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "\t\tENV = gym.make(\"LunarLander-v2\")\n",
    "\t\t\n",
    "- The input dimension NUM_INPUT is obtained by resetting the environment:\n",
    "\t\t\n",
    "\t\tNUM_INPUT = ENV.reset().shape[0]\n",
    "\n",
    "- Thee actions are obtained by the environment method action_space:\n",
    "\n",
    "\t\tNUM_ACTION = ENV.action_space.n\n",
    "\t\t\n",
    "- The action space then is simply an enumeration:    \n",
    "\n",
    "\t\tACTIONS = np.arange(0, NUM_ACTION)\n",
    "\n",
    "__Code snippet 01__ shows the implementation of the environment initialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Environment Interaction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The main building block describing the interaction of the agent with the environment (during one epoch)\n",
    "\n",
    "- contains more than zero episodes. \n",
    "\n",
    "- records statistics (stats) along the way:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The reward sum per episode\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - The number of times the lander did a successful step during the episode (with a reward greater or equal 100)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - The number of times a step was solved (with a reward greater or equal 200)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - The number of times the agent has revisited states, compared to the size of the Q table.\n",
    "\n",
    "It looks as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\t# Define a training epoch\n",
    "\tdef training_epoch():\n",
    "\t\t# Play through a pre-defined number of episodes\n",
    "\t\tfor episode in range(NUM_EPISODE):         \n",

    "            and set the episode state to not done */\n",
    "\t\t\tx_t = ENV.reset()\n",
    "\t\t\tdone = False\n",
    "\t\t\t/* Start an episode, \n",
    "            let it run as long as it is not done\n",
    "            each step is denoted with `t` */\n",

    "                and the episode state after action a_t */\n",
    "\t\t\t\tx_t, r_t, done, info = ENV.step(a_t)\n",
    "\t\t\t\t# Train the model\n",
    "\t\t\t\t## [Y]\n",
    "\t\t\t\t# Exit episode after crash or deadlock\n",
    "\t\t\t\tif done or step > MAX_NUM_STEPS: break  \n",
    "\t\t\t\t\n",
    "[X] and [Y] are denoting the crucial moments of choosing an action and updating the experience. `NUM_EPISODE` denotes  the number of episodes to play during an epoch. `MAX_NUM_STEPS` denotes the maximum allowed steps per episode to avoid deadlock.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Sidenote: this code and some of the following are slightly altered w.r.t. the code in the code section. This is due to formatting / page size reasons in markdown.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benchmark\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The benchmark metrics for comparing the different algorithms can be directly derived from the reward obtained during the course of an epoch. The main question is: *Is the problem solved?* A solved step will be rewarded with 200 points. As a secondary measure, *successful steps* (with a reward of >= 100) are measured.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the project, sucesses and solutions are tracked for each episode, for each epoch. \n",
    "\n",
    "An epoch will entail 150 episodes (`NUM_EPISODES`) each. The lower benchmark is set by the Q learning algorithm, followed by epochs which implement step-by-step to a fully fledged Deep Q learning algorithm. The latter then sets the higher benchmark for the following Policy Gradient algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## III. Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The input data / state space provided by Open AI Gym is already preprocessed. It is a 1D vector, which means that a convolution is not needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, I argue that it might make sense to let the agent take into account more than just the current state, when taking an action. As such, the \"memory\" of the agent will extend to `n` past state spaces, which requires stacking of state spaces. It becomes a parameter (`STEP_MEM`) which can be tuned during experimentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The random initialization of observations becomes\n",
    "\n",
    "\t\t/* Pile up STEP_MEM times the same init observation, \n",
    "        in order to be consistent with the model input */\n",
    "\t\ts_t = np.tile(x_t, STEP_MEM)\n",
    "\t\t\n",
    "After having observed a new state space `x_t`, I stack the new state space on top of the state space queue:\n",
    "\n",
    "\t\t# Create state at t1: Append x observations, throw away the earliest\n",
    "\t\ts_t1 = np.concatenate((x_t, s_t[:(STEP_MEM-1) * NUM_INPUT,]), axis=0) \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation and Refinement\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Starting Point: Evaluating Bellman Equations From Data (Q-Learning)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q-Learning is a variant of *Temporal Difference-Learning (TD Learning)*, where the agent assesses the benefit of an action, instead of the state it is in. An agent performing according to a TD-Learning algorithm does wait until it gets the final reward, but adjusts after every action on basis of an estimated expected reward.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q learning is about revisiting states. The agent is given a *memory* in form of a lookup table, where it stores states `s`, and updates the punishment or reward for each action it has taken. \n",
    "\n",
    "The number of possible combinations of the relevant inputs which constitute a state is called the state space. Whenever the state space is sufficiently small, the agent - at step `t` - might discover that it has already been in a specific state `s`. It therefore has made an experience by taking an action.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the agent should take advantage of its \"memory\" (possibly a dictionary of dictionaries, main keys being the states, values being the actions / keys and their values), it should use previous experiences and update them with new experiences:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It looks up the expected lifetime rewards per each possible action in `s` (a.k.a. action-value function, `q` values), selects the maximum `q` value, and executes the chosen action. \n",
    "\n",
    "- It obtains fresh evidence about the consequence of a specific action in a specific state: It knows the initial state `s_t`, the selected action `a_t`, the reward `r_t`, and the new state this all lead to, `s_t1`. \n",
    "\n",
    "- This knowledge it now uses to calculate a new `q` value for `s_t` by taking the observed reward `r_t`, and adding to it the discounted maximum `q` value for `s_t1`. The difference to the old `q` value is the new `q` value for action `a_t` in state `s_t`.\n",
    "\n",
    "It then chooses the action with the highest associated `q` value (<=> the maximum of the `q` function, or: the highest expected lifetime reward at step `t`) and moves onward another step.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Q-Learning Often Does Not Work: Exploding State Spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The crux about state spaces is, that they can get very large very quickly. Just think of a small number of inputs, each input being a floating number with 4 digits. Even this small setting is creating a large amount of combinations: the state space explodes. Revisiting states will become very unlikely, even with a large amount of trials. As a consequence, learning is slow, or even not happening.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Code snippet 04__ illustrates the point by setting up a Q Learning algorithm. \n",
    "\t\n",
    "One clearly can see that a simple table lookup is not adequate anymore. There is most often simply nothing to look up, since the state space is so huge. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What to Do? Do Not Update the Q Function, But the Q Function Estimator: Deep Q Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "With the fast growth of the state space for the Lunar Lander game in mind, I intend to replace the table lookup by a function approximator. An Artifical Neural Net (ANN) will estimate the `q` function for the state `s` at step `t`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the agent has performed an action, it will know the reward `r_t` and the subsequent state `s_t1`. Based on this, it is able to update its memory. But this time, it does not update the `q` function directly. Instead, it is updating the ANN, which means that is updating the weights used in the ANN:\n",
    "\n",
    "- At time `t`, the agent already knows the *estimation* of the `q` function for state `s_t`: It used it to pick an action `a_t` accordingly. \n",
    "\n",
    "- After action `a_t`, the agent knows `s_t`, `a_t`, `r_t` and `s_t1`. This allows us to update the `q` function, *but only for the action taken*:  The discounted expected lifetime reward is added to `r_t`. In other words: The ANN estimates the `q` function for state `s_t1`. \n",
    "\n",
    "- For the action taken, the agent now updates the `q` value. All the other actions are not performed, the agent does not know about the reward, or a subsequent state `s_t1`. So, the agent cannot learn for those. This updated `q` function is the *target*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The error, which is the difference between the estimation and the target, is backpropagated through the network, such that the weights are updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next time the agent lets estimate the `q` function for another state `s`, it will have updated weights at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Deep Q Learning from Single Current Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to implement the Q estimator, the training epoch function described in __code snippet 04__ needs to be changed. The lookup table `Q_TABLE` and the table's `q` value initialization `Q_INIT` are both not needed anymore. In plus, I do not need the learning rate `ALPHA` anymore. \n",
    "\n",
    "The core routine implemented for the function estimate is an ANN block. For this task I chose Keras and its `Sequential` model architecture. For the Deep Q Learning part of the project, the sequential model consists of \n",
    "\n",
    "- one fully-connected hidden layer (Keras terminology is `Dense`) plus an non-linear `relu` Activation, \n",
    "\n",
    "- the output layer with softmax activation, which produces probabilities for each of the possible actions given a certain state input. Here, I am not entirely sure if using probabilities in stead of a regression output is against some rules in Deep Q Learning. I tried also a linear activation and thereby found out that the probabilities are working very nicely. (Comments on this are very welcome.)\n",
    "\n",
    "This set-up is found after some preliminary experimentation in the parameter space, including visual checks of the landing procedure.\n",

    "- For the model update, standard Q learning acts as the target, upon which (supervised learning) the ANN is trained using the Keras function `model.fit` (Note that the target is set to the reward in case the episode is terminated):\n",

    "        \n",
    "#### *Epsilon Greedy* Deep Q Learning from Single Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, it is time to tackle the issue of getting stuck in local minima. As a remedy, Deep Q Learning makes use the so called *epsilon greedy* action selection policy.

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### A Methododical Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, I have performed Value-based Reinforcement Learning by trying to find the maximum value over all possible actions in a given state. The policy thereby was generated from the value function. Another approach would be to directly parametrize the policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both approaches have pros and cons. Policy-based RL has better convergence properties. It does not need a maximum value, which is of great interest in continuous action spaces. On the other hand, policy-based RL often converges towards local in stead of global optima, and they suffer from high variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Taking An Action\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent faces the decision of taking one of the available actions at every step `t`. When applying a policy gradient model, the agent estimates which move is most likely to lead to a good end / a high reward: It assigns probabilities to every action. In order to accomplish this, a first ANN block is needed, which outputs probabilities / uses a softmax at the output layer. It is called the policy estimator.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the estimation, it samples uniformly from the probability distribution in order to get an action, and observes / learns from the consequences of the action.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Evaluating An Action\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "An example for Policy-based RL is the Monte-Carlo Policy Gradient algorithm, which is also known as REINFORCE. It is first presented here.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic principle of the REINFORCE algorithm is to sample from the action-value function q by using the collected returns of a full episode: After each episode, the algorithm runs through each time step again and calculates the target (a value function), which is the total discounted reward after a specific step (the expected return is sampled directly from the episode), representing a sample of the action-value function. It multiplies the target with the score function at each time step to get the gradient. The score function is the negative log probability of the chosen action.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the trajectory (the time steps of an episode), the transitions are collected for the later adaption of the policy after the episode.\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm suffers from high variance, because the sampled rewards can be very different from one episode to another. Therefore this algorithm is usually used with a baseline function B(s) substracted from the target. Over all states s in the state space S, the expectation of the policy gradient is still 0, so expectations do not change.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of the target, the score is multiplied with the advantage function, which is simply the target minus the baseline. A suitable baseline is the state value function, which is a value function estimate. For this, I need a second ANN block, the so called value estimator, outputting a regression estimate by applying a mean squared error loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, the advantage captures how much better than expected the action at time step t was doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last presented algorithm, the Action-Value (or Q) Actor-Critic algorithm, is again a Temporal-Difference-based algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "Actor-critic are a mix between value based and policy based frameworks. The actor is taking the action, the critic is evaluating the action. In contrast to REINFORCE, the latter is done during the episode. This bootstrapping from the value function leads to lower variance, but also to higher bias, compared with REINFORCE.\n",
    "\n",
    "The target / value function for Q Actor-Critic algorithms is the estimated cumulated reward, which consists of the actual reward at s_t plus a discounted estimated reward for the action at `s_t1`: `target = r_t + GAMMA * Q_sa`. Again, the value function estimate is subtracted from the target. The resulting advantage is then multiplied with the score function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Policy gradient methods need two kinds of different estimators:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The value estimator\n",
    "\n",
    "- The policy estimator\n",
    "\n",
    "For this purpose, I recreate the existing `_create_network` function. I will use a different set of initializations as well as hidden layer activations for the two models. The policy estimator has a softmax activation for the output layer, the value estimator a linear activation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to the model the non-standard gradients in Keras, a helper function is needed. Getting the gradients subsequently is relying directly on TensorFlow, applying `tf.gradients()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Code snippet 08__ is showing the new `create_network` function as well as the gradient helper function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Monte Carlo Policy Gradient method is implemented in __code snippet 09__. Note that the agent learns only after having finished an episode, which results in low bias and high variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Action-Value (Q) Actor-Critic is implemented in __code snippet 10__. In contrary to the Monte Carlo Policy Gradient implementation, the algorithm bootstraps from the value function during the episode, which results in higher bias, but lower variance.\n",

When performing HPC on AWS EC2, I started with Ubuntu 16.04 t2.micro free tier instances, then switched to Ubuntu 16.04 c4.8xlarge instances. The insufficient speed forced me to move on to bare metal GPU instances on AWS. I finally ended up using pre-configured Bitfusion Ubuntu 14 TensorFlow instances available on Amazon Marketplace, which spared me hours of setting up software and drivers, but still needed some tweaking. The g-version instances as well as the p2.xlarge were not performing as needed, so I went for the p2.8xlarge, which for ca. 5'000 policy gradient episodes needs around 24 hours.\n",

    "\n",
    "    - Average episode rewards stay at around -5 , and a relatively high variation. It seems as if the algorithm produces average rewards which oscillate up and down over the epochs.\n",
    "    - Summed up episode rewards also seem to oscillate over epochs, showing extreme peaks (up to almost 200, down to -1'400), and averaging at -600 overall.\n",
    "    - Successful steps are performed steadily over the epoch. There are hardly any periods during learning where the algorithm produces significantly less or more successes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implemented Q Actor-Critic\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Average episode rewards stay at around -3.5  very stably, having a smaller variation. The peaks tend to go to the positive side.\n",

    "Overall, the Deep Q Learning algorithm performs on a lower level, producing more variation and even oscillation. In contrary to the Q Actor-Critic algorithm, which in average tends to perform better, but never leaves mediocrity, the Deep Q Learning algorithm is able to peak in performance from time to time, and producing successful, or - as seen before - even solved steps.\n",

    "### Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "This project reflects the development and the learning curve which I had to undergo:\n",
    "\n",
    "I have presented a basic implementation of an Artificial Neural Network, and I have gone the way from *Smartcab* Q Learning to Deep Q Learning by applying step-by-step extensions to the original algorithm. I afterwards presented two more Reinforcement Learning algorithms and let them undergo a testing procedure for comparison reasons. \n",
    "\n",
    "Having a more hands-on approach in mind, it was challenging to understand the concepts and to implement them in a generic, as-simple-as-possible way. Without the many resources on the net this would not have been possible. I belief that toy code is the best way to learn, and luckily there were others sharing their experience (see below-standing credits for details).\n",
    "\n",
    "It was extremely insightful to bring different concepts under one generic methological hood. Looking at the differences in different portions of the code made many concept clearer.\n",
    "\n",
    "I now have a clear indication about the nature of the algorithms and Artifical Neural Networks in general. I know some of the tools to use (Keras and TensorFlow). I have a clear indication that hardware constraints are a paramount topic with Reinforcement Learning, and that a well developed test design is worth a lot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing evolvement and design was not a straight line, but trial-and-error, resulting in a suboptimal testing set-up. It was clearly a matter of underrating the vast parameter space associated especially with Artificial Neural Networks, which resulted in a considerable amount of time spent for testing as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the minus side, a Box2D dependency deserves a short side note, being a major productivity slowdown with its erratic installation behaviour. On the plus side, a thanks to the helpful *Bitfusion* guys.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final solutions do not quite match my initial expectations. Of course, I had an agent with a steeper learning curve in mind. But since this project was intended only to be a starting point to fix the basics, and Deep Q Learning partially went into the right direction. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many questionmarks left:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Are the ANN models accurate?\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Are the RL algorithms accurate?\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Is a deadlock prevention really part of the algorithm, or should the agent be allowed to try infinitely many times?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Not all questions raised when testing the basic Deep Q Learning algorithm have been answered: Which are the parameters to put emphasis upon when testing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding these questions, I am of course grateful for inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no doubt that Reinforcement Learning algorithms are an extremely valuable way to go when it comes to self-learning agents / robots in games or in reality. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "My final benchmark is easily surpassed by other existing solutions. \n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in the *Reflection* section, Improvements start with scrutinizing architectures, and continue with adapt the test design and hardware allocation. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are other RL algorithms around, which also could be taken into consideration. Having not presented them in this project was a matter of choice. Intellegible, hands-on instructions exist for a plethora of other algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "After having established true learning curves for the agent using stabilized models and algorithms, one can think of saving the weights and make available those pre-trained models (keywords `model.save_weights()` and `model.load_weights()` with Keras), or going to the Open AI Gym competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it is a task to generalize the algorithms to a multitude of different MDPs and see how they perform. Narrowing them down to one environment  - Lunar Lander - is only the first step.\n",
